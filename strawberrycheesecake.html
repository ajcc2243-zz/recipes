    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h3>Make The Crust</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Move the oven rack to the lower third position and heat the oven to 350°F. Wrap the outer bottom of a 9-inch springform pan tightly with aluminium foil. </li>
        <li>Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and about 2-inches up the sides of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool while you make the filling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make The Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Add the sugar and sour cream, beat until well combined. Add the vanilla and salt, beat on low speed until smooth. </li>
        <li>Using a silicone spatula, gently stir in the eggs just until combined. Pour the batter over the prepared crust.</li>
        <li>Fill a roasting pan with a few inches of boiling water and place the cheesecake in the center. </li>
        <li>Bake for 1 hour, OR until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly. Turn the oven off, leave the cheesecake in the water bath in the oven for another hour. </li>
        <li>Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and place it on a wire rack. Run a small knife around the outer edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the pan and leave it to cool at room temperature for about 1 ½ hours. Meanwhile, make the sauce. <br><b>Alternatively, you can refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight after it has cooled and make the sauce about 1 hour before serving. Top the chilled cheesecake with the sauce or top individual slices when ready to serve.</b></li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Make The Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the diced strawberries and cornstarch to the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a medium saucepan and add the sugar.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, salt, and chopped strawberries. Set aside to cool for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Spread the topping evenly over the cheesecake and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove the sides of the pan just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <b>Oven temps can vary which means your cheesecake may need more time to bake. You'll know it is done cooking when the outer edges of the cheesecake feel firm to the touch while the center looks wet and jiggles when shaken. If the cheesecake doesn't look this way after an hour of cooking, let it cook until it does. Then you can turn the oven off and let the cheesecake rest for another hour in the oven.</b>
